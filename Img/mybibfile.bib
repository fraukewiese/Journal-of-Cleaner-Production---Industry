abstract = {There has been growing interest in developing Locally Integrated Energy Sectors (LIES) as a Process (Heat) Integration approach for synergising the industrial thermal energy systems that include renewable energy resources with urban (i.e. civic, residential, business and service complexes). The aim is to enhance the regional energy efficiency and minimise greenhouse gas (including carbon) emissions. However, a comprehensive planning and design framework is crucial at the onset of its development, which is accounting for supply and demand sides, but there have been limited works directed to this scope to date. For the development of such framework, this paper reviews the energy consumption targeting methodologies via Total Site Heat Integration for estimating and designing the capacity of the utility have been reviewed in this work, inclusive of both insight-based Pinch Analysis and mathematical modelling approaches. As a final outcome of the review, suggestions are provided for investigating key factors for integration of industrial, residential, commercial, institutional and service energy systems, maximising the integration and reuse of waste and low potential heat, including renewables to boost sustainability aspects. The review of methodologies for energy system integration is followed by identification of research directions that deserve future attention, refinement and development.},

abstract = {Industrial activities are responsible for a significant share of both global delivered energy demand and CO2 emissions. Hence, a widespread adoption of energy-efficient technologies and practices represents a crucial means for sustainable production. Adopting a novel framework of drivers for energy efficiency describing the effect of drivers on barriers in the decision-making process steps and able to account for the nature of drivers and the stakeholders responsible for their promotion, we have performed an exploratory investigation into 61 manufacturing small- and medium-sized enterprises in Northern Italy. Our findings have highlighted the importance of information and economic drivers, showing the need for enterprises to be supported not only by public institutions but also by external stakeholders involved in the supply of energy-efficient technologies and practices such as industrial associations and groupings, as well as service and technology suppliers. Moreover, our study has highlighted an almost equal relevance of both internal and external drivers. According to our findings, the increase of awareness—generating the interest to energy issues and stimulated both by external and internal stakeholders—as well as financial issues have emerged as the most critical in the decision-making process to adopt an energy-efficient measure. A preliminary comprehension of the mechanisms relating drivers to barriers in the decision-making process brought additional value to the study, highlighting the most effective and specific means to overcome the existing barriers. We have also explored the effect of several firm characteristics, such as firm size and energy intensity offering suggestions for industrial decision-makers as well as policy-makers.},

abstract = {Industrial energy efficiency has raised to the top of European energy policy agenda, and particular efforts should be placed to tackle the barriers to energy efficiency of small and non-energy intensive industrial users. To enhance the adoption rate of a specific industrial energy efficiency measure, it is crucial to properly evaluate the barriers. Without a proper level of detail - considering both the measure's specificity and the evaluation's perspective - company managers are hampered when making investment decisions, and policymakers are prevented from developing the most effective policies. The paper aims at highlighting that the value of a given intervention-dependent barrier may differ when evaluating it at the company level, by technology area, or with respect to a specific measure. To achieve this objective, an exploratory investigation of Italian small and medium-sized enterprises into the metalworking sector has been performed with respect to selected cross-cutting technologies. Although general barriers appear as most relevant at the company level, large differences appear when considering intervention-dependent barriers by technology area as well as at the energy efficiency measure level. The research presents innovative results, as the literature and policymakers have not accounted so far for how the value of barriers can effectively vary with respect to a single measure, but have only considered barriers at company level. Additionally, the paper highlights that differences can be appreciated when evaluating the intervention-dependent barriers according to some firm characteristics (i.e. size, production complexity, and innovativeness). The study concludes with suggestions for policymakers as well as industrial decision-makers. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Detailed end-use models for fourteen intensive industries are established using scattered data from the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS). Since the MECS data exhibit many gaps, data from other sources are used, as well as a number of assumptions are made to complete the models. The methodology applied and the assumptions made are clearly described so that the methods can be readily modified to fit different needs. The end-use models provide a starting point to estimate the site and embodied energy and exergy efficiencies. The average site energy and exergy efficiencies of the manufacturing sector are estimated as 63.5{\%} and 38.8{\%} respectively, while the embodied energy and exergy efficiencies are estimated as 52.7{\%} and 32.1{\%} respectively. The low efficiency values suggest that many opportunities for better industrial energy utilization still exist. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to assess the use of quality of energy in Iran's industrial sector. The exergy analysis has been performed along with energy analysis, in order to gain deeper and more realistic understanding of the sector's condition. Primary energy utilization from seventeen different industries has been considered for calculation of the exergy and energy efficiencies for each industry, and later for Iran's industrial sector. The exergy efficiency is much lower than energy efficiency in all industries and also in the industrial sector. It is shown that based on the results from exergy analysis the priorities for efficiency improvement are different from that of energy analysis; this in turn suggests that exergy analysis as a proper tool for policy makers. The sources of energy degradation and the mechanisms which cause degradation of quality of energy have been identified. Moreover remedial actions for better utilization of quality of energy are proposed. The energy and exergy efficiencies for the entire industrial sector of Iran were approximated as 63{\%} and 42{\%}, respectively. The oil, iron and steel, plastic and cement industries are found to have the highest share in destruction of quality of total input energy to the industrial sector. The aluminum industry has the highest exergy efficiency of 52.5{\%}. Mean entropic temperature is also proposed as a tool for understanding the degree of quality of energy required in each industry and consequently better quality matching which leads to better energy quality utilization. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Four principal sub-sectors, namely iron and steel, chemical and petrochemical, mining and quarrying, and non-ferrous metals/non-metallic minerals were considered in this study. Primary-energy utilization data were used to calculate the weighted mean energy and exergy efficiencies for the sub-sectors and then overall values for the industrial sector were obtained. The results indicate that exergy efficiency is considerably lower than energy efficiency in all the sub-sectors, particularly in mining and quarrying processes, for which the values were approximately 83{\%} and 16{\%}, respectively. The performance of exergy utilization in the industrial sector can be improved by introducing various conservation strategies.

Ved scenarier forst{\aa}s i denne sammenh{\ae}ng teknisk konsistente modeller eller billeder af den fremtidige energiforsyning i Danmark inkl. transport, der overholder givne politiske m{\aa}ls{\ae}tninger. Da hele systemet er med i scenarierne, belyses ogs{\aa} relationen mellem energisystemets delsektorer. Herigennem s{\o}ges sikret en sammenh{\ae}ng mellem de enkelte sektoranalyser m.h.t. ressourceanvendelse og energioms{\ae}tning. Scenarierne overholder alle den fossilfrie vision i 2050 samt regeringens m{\aa}l om fossilfri el og varme i 2035. Desuden belyses et scenarie med anvendelse af fossil energi. Scenarierne har til form{\aa}l at belyse spillerummet for den fremtidige danske energiforsyning og danner en f{\ae}lles ramme om de analyser, der blev igangsat med energiaftalen fra 22. marts 2012. Scenarierne skal belyse de tekniske muligheder for at ”konstruere” fremtidens danske energisystem under givne pr{\ae}misser og anskueligg{\o}re, hvilke udfordringer overgangen til fossilfrihed indeb{\ae}rer, samt hvad der er de kritiske parametre. Herudover kan scenarierne bidrage til at kaste lys over, hvorn{\aa}r vigtige valg skal tr{\ae}ffes. Scenarierne skal ikke forst{\aa}s som detaljerede prognoser eller ”facitlister” for, hvordan fremtidens energisystem kommer til at se ud eller b{\o}r se ud. Desuden er der ikke taget stilling til, hvilke virkemidler der skal til for at realisere scenarierne. Nettoenergiforbruget i scenarierne er beregnet p{\aa} en forbrugsmodel, der modellerer energiforbruget i 2035 og 2050 fordelt p{\aa} energikvaliteter ved tre forskellige niveauer af energibesparelser (moderate, store besparelser og ekstra store besparelser). Der medregnes el, fjernvarme, procesvarme, individuel opvarmning og transportenergi (inkl. al flytrafik og indenlandsk skibstrafik). Olie- og gasindvindingssektoren holdes uden for analyserne. Der er forudsat samme energitjenesteniveau i alle scenarier, dvs. der indg{\aa}r samme produktion fra erhvervene, samme opvarmede boligareal, samme trafikarbejde osv. Dermed er det ogs{\aa} implicit antaget, at teknologierne, der varierer mellem scenarier, er perfekte substitutter, fx at en elbil leverer samme brugsv{\ae}rdi som en bil med forbr{\ae}ndingsmotor. Energiproduktionen i scenarierne er gennemregnet p{\aa} en timesimuleringsmodel, hvormed de n{\o}dvendige kapaciteter og det {\aa}rlige br{\ae}ndselsforbrug bestemmes. P{\aa} baggrund af timesimuleringen er omkostningerne til drift og vedligehold af de opstillede energisystemer opgjort. I opg{\o}relsen af omkostningerne indg{\aa}r annuiserede investeringsomkostninger, hvor teknologidata tages fra de nyeste teknologikataloger, hvori der indg{\aa}r vurderinger af den forventede teknologiudvikling frem mod 2050. Br{\ae}ndselsprisudviklingen antages at v{\ae}re i overensstemmelse med de tre scenarier i World Energy Outlook 2013 (Current Policies Scenario, New Policies Scenario, 450 Scenario).},

abstract = {The German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) is home to one of the most important industrial regions in Europe, and is the first German state to have adopted its own Climate Protection Law (CPL). This paper describes the long-term (up to 2050) mitigation scenarios for NRW's main energy-intensive industrial sub-sectors which served to support the implementation of the CPL. It also describes the process of scenario development, as these scenarios were developed through stakeholder participation. The scenarios considered three different pathways (best-available technologies, break-through technologies, and CO2 capture and storage). All pathways had optimistic assumptions on the rate of industrial growth and availability of low-carbon electricity. We find that a policy of "re-industrialisation" for NRW based on the current industrial structures (assumed here to represent an average growth of NRWs industrial gross value added (GVA) of 1.6{\%} per year until 2030 and 0.6{\%} per year from 2030 to 2050), would pose a significant challenge for the achievement of overall energy demand and German greenhouse gas (GHG) emission targets, in particular as remaining efficiency potentials in NRW are limited. In the best-available technology (BAT) scenario CO2 emission reductions of only 16{\%} are achieved, whereas the low carbon (LC) and the carbon capture and storage (CCS) scenario achieve 50{\%} and 79{\%} reduction respectively. Our results indicate the importance of successful development and implementation of a decarbonised electricity supply and breakthrough technologies in industry-such as electrification, hydrogen-based processes for steel, alternative cements or CCS-if significant growth is to be achieved in combination with climate mitigation. They, however, also show that technological solutions alone, together with unmitigated growth in consumption of material goods, could be insufficient to meet GHG reduction targets in industry.},

abstract = {Excess heat is available from various sources and its utilisation could reduce the primary energy use. The accessibility of this heat is however dependent amongst others on the source and sink temperature, amount and potential users in its vicinity. In this work a new method is developed which analyses excess heat sources from the industrial sector and how they could be used for district heating. This method first allocates excess heat to single production units by introducing and validating a new approach. Spatial analysis of the heat sources and consumers are then performed to evaluate the potential for using them for district heating. In this way the theoretical potential of using the excess heat for covering the heating demand of buildings is determined. Through the use of industry specific temperature profiles the heat usable directly or via heat pumps is further found. A sensitivity analysis investigates the impact of future energy efficiency measures in the industry, buildings and the district heating grid on the national potential. The results show that for the case study of Denmark, 1.36 TWh of district heat could be provided annually with industrial excess heat from thermal processes which equals 5.1{\%} of the current demand. More than half of this heat was found to be usable directly, without the need for a heat pump.},

abstract = {Households represent one of the most interesting sectors, when analyzing Croatia's energy balance. It makes up one of the largest energy consumers with around 75. PJ per year, which is almost 29{\%} of Croatia's final energy demand. Considering this consumption, implementing various mechanisms, which would lead to improvements in energy efficiency of this sector, seems relevant. In order to plan future energy systems, important would be to know future possibilities and needs regarding energy demand of different sectors. Through this paper, long term energy demand projections of Croatian households sector will be shown. Focus of the paper will be on various mechanisms influencing future energy demand scenarios. Important would be to quantify this influence, whether positive or negative, and see which mechanisms would be the most significant. Energy demand projections in this paper are based upon bottom-up approach model which combines and processes a large number of input data. The model will be compared to Croatian National Energy Strategy and certain differences and conclusions will be presented. One of the major conclusions shown in this paper is significant possibilities for energy efficiency improvements and lower energy demand in the future, based on careful and rational energy planning. Different financial, legal and technological mechanisms can lead to significant savings in the households sector which leads to lower GHG emissions and lower Croatian dependence on foreign fossil fuels. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recognizing the need to increase energy efficiency across various sectors of the economy, the Brazilian government through the national energy efficiency plan (adopted in 2011) seeks to avoid 30 million tons of CO2 emissions through a reduction in electricity consumption of about 10{\%} by 2030. Notwithstanding, we believe that a complete realization of such initiative will be dependent on the level of substitutability between different production factors and fuel types. Using the translog production function method, this paper, first provides insight on the economic impact of both factor and fuel inputs in Brazil. Most importantly, we examine the possibility of substitution among capital, labor, petroleum, and electricity. The ridge regression technique was used to estimate the parameters after our data depicted the existence of multicollinearity. Our results show that capital and labor are positively linked to output; however, petroleum and electricity contribute negatively to economic output in Brazil of which corruption is a plausible reason. Again, all variable inputs are substitutes with their relative technological progress depicting features of convergence. This implies that Brazil can achieve a cleaner energy system without much challenges due to the possibility of switching from greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting petroleum to a cleaner energy electricity. Our findings also highlight the importance of policies that advance merger of enterprises, and renewable energy use.},

@article{Pusnik2017,
abstract = {Energy efficiency measures and the utilisation of renewable energy sources have been consistently incorporated into the energy strategy documents of the EU Member States in various sectors. Industry, as the backbone of the European economy, is still not sufficiently addressed, since its development is almost exclusively market driven. The importance of the industrial sector for the economy is not questionable, nor is its impact on the environment. More than a quarter of all final energy consumption in Europe can be attributed to the industrial sector, representing one third of the final energy consumption of natural gas and one third of electricity use, with more than three quarters of all final energy consumption of solid fuels. The paper presents an overview of the energy efficiency development trends in Slovenian industry. To assess the development of energy efficiency, an energy efficiency index (ODEX) is applied, also highlighting some of the non-technical, structural changes. Furthermore, the future development prospects of energy-intensive industry in Slovenia are addressed in compliance with the national legislative framework and energy efficiency targets.},

abstract = {Despite its huge potential for increasing sustainability, the use of solar energy in industry is still scarce. Many industrial thermal demands range from 120 to 250 °C, which are difficult to supply using solar energy because of the lack of specific solar thermal conversion devices. Parabolic-trough collectors (PTCs) suitable for these applications should be small due to space constraints. This study addressed the specific design of a small-sized industrial PTC with a flat transparent cover in the aperture plane. The cover is critical to the success of this technology in industrial environments, because it ensures protection of the rest of the collector components, which may have very poor durability. The cover also increases rigidity and makes cleaning easier. Three different PTCs with the same basic geometry were analysed by numerical simulation. Two of them had glass receiver tube covers, one with an additional flat cover in the aperture plane and the other one without it. The third one had an uncovered receiver but a flat cover in the aperture plane. Simulations showed that the collector design with a flat glass aperture cover only has the highest thermal losses. The design with both flat glass aperture and tube covers has lower thermal losses than the one with a glass tube cover only. However, optical-geometric efficiency is inferior and, as a result, overall efficiency is slightly lower. In addition, thermal insulation on the reflector back is not recommended.},

@article{Chaturvedi2016,
abstract = {In a batch process, either direct or indirect heat integration may be employed. The former involves direct heat transfer from hot to cold process streams. In the latter, heat from a hot process stream is first transferred to an intermediate fluid where the heat is stored until it is finally transferred to a cold stream. Storage of product streams allows direct heat integration to be delayed, thereby providing an opportunity for energy conservation while avoiding the use of an intermediate fluid. This paper presents a new methodology for batch heat integration that involves the direct storage of product streams within the procedure to set the minimum utility targets. Application of the proposed methodology on illustrative examples demonstrates that significant energy reduction can be achieved by shifting product streams on the time scale. Potential reductions of 33.2{\%} cold utility and 45.1{\%} hot utility were estimated for the first example when the product stream was stored. Similarly, reductions of 3.5{\%} cold utility and 6.5{\%} hot utility were observed for a two-product batch plant when the cooling requirement for one of the products was shifted on time scale.},

@article{Bando2017,
abstract = {Freeze drying is a drying technology that removes water from a target by sublimation of ice to vapor. Drying at low temperature and pressure (below the triple point) results in fewer physical and chemical changes to the dried products compared with the changes observed when using other drying technologies, leading to producing a high quality product. However, the weak point of freeze-drying technology is its large energy consumption. It is therefore necessary to reduce the energy required for the freeze-drying process and the energy costs of production so that this technology can be extended to the drying of other products. In this paper, a new energy-saving freeze-drying process based on the concept of self-heat recuperation technology was proposed. The energy required for the proposed process was compared with a conventional technique using a commercial process simulator. From the simulation results, more than 80{\%} of the energy required for drying can be saved by using the proposed process.},

abstract = {•TES system can increase energy efficiency while reducing carbon footprint.•Waste heat recovery using PCM helps to reduce the heat production from fossil fuels.•Environmental benefits, in terms of carbon footprint, are identified in this study.•PCM with high latent heat value tend to achieve better results in the overall system.•The KNO3manufacture entails higher carbon footprint values than other PCM analysed. Until now, a small number of studies have analysed the carbon footprint (CO2eq. emissions) of the application of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) in conventional Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems considering different conventional fossil fuels as the source of heat. In those scarce studies, the different environmental impact categories were estimated using, on the one hand, diverse environmental methodologies and, on the other hand, different environmental evaluation methods (the midpoint and endpoint approaches). Despite the fact that several researchers have used the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology as a tool to estimate the environmental impact of TES systems, there is no unanimity in the scientific community on the environmental evaluation method to be used. As a consequence, research results cannot be easily compared. This article evaluates the introduction of a TES system (using different PCMs) to recover the waste thermal energy released in industrial processes, which can be used in other applications, thereby avoiding fossil fuel consumption by the associated equipment to produce thermal energy. Five different fossil fuels have been considered to generate the 20 case studies that were analysed using the same methodology (LCA) and evaluation method (Global Warming Potential, GWP100, a midpoint approach). The results were used to identify the best cases, considering the environmental benefits that they generate. Additionally, this research indicates that the benefits can be achieved since, in general, the amount of conventional fuels saved is sufficiently large to balance the environmental impact associated with the inclusion of PCMs in conventional TES. Nevertheless, the selection of a PCM can increase or eliminate the environmental benefits obtained.},

abstract = {In this study, we simulate global CO2 emissions and their reduction potentials in the industrial sector up to the year 2030. Future industrial CO2 emissions depend on changes in both technology and industrial activity. However, earlier bottom-up analyses mainly focused on technology change. In this study, we estimate changes in both technology and industrial activity. We developed a three-part simulation system. The first part is a macro economic model that simulates macro economic indicators, such as GDP and value added by sector. The second part consists of industrial production models that simulate future steel and cement production. The third part is a bottom-up type technology model that estimates future CO2 emissions. Assuming no changes in technology since 2005, we estimate that global CO2 emissions in 2030 increase by 15 GtCO2 from 2005 level. This increase is due to growth in industrial production. Introducing technological reduction options within 100 US{\$}/tCO2 provides a reduction potential of 5.3 GtCO2 compared to the case of no technology changes. As a result, even with large technological reduction potential, global industrial CO2 emissions in 2030 are estimated to be higher as compared to 2005 level because of growth of industrial production. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A financial computable general equilibrium model is established to quantitatively calculate the systematic effects of a green credit policy. The punitive high-interest rate is applied to the energy-intensive industries as the green credit policy. This study is focused on the following industries: paper, chemical, cement, and iron and steel. Short-, medium- and long-term scenarios are used to conduct experiments representing the green credit policy. Then, a scenario is simulated wherein a green security policy and the green credit policy are carried out simultaneously. Finally, effects of the green credit policy, a differential electricity price policy, and a raised production tax policy towards the energy-intensive industries are compared. The results show that the green credit policy is effective in suppressing the investments in energy-intensive industries, and it is comparatively less effective in adjusting the industrial production structure. The green security policy helps the green credit policy to reduce the total financing of the target industries, but it brings more negative impacts on the economy. Although the policies of differential electricity prices and raising production taxes support the output structural adjustments, their negative effects are much larger than those of the green credit policy.},

abstract = {As the world's largest carbon emitter, China is confronting a great challenge to mitigate its carbon emissions. The construction industry is one of the major contributors to the carbon emissions in China. This study investigated the driving factors of the changes in the carbon emissions in the Chinese construction industry by using the structural decomposition analysis method and the data from the World Input-Output Database. The results show that the total final demand effect contributed most (131{\%}) to the increase in the construction carbon emissions, while the energy intensity effect offset the largest part (108{\%}) of the increase during the whole period. The production structure effect and final demand ratio effect contributed 49{\%} and 35{\%} to the total increase in the carbon emissions between 1995 and 2009, respectively. The carbonization factor effect had a very small decrease impact (7{\%}) on the carbon emissions between 1995 and 2009. The trends of the effects of driving factors during 1995–2009 and the contributions by industries to the effects of driving factors between 1999 and 2009 have been further explored.

abstract = {Pulp and paper plants produce large amount of sludge. Environmental problems connected with this waste were not solved satisfactorily in the past. Since land-filling is not a suitable solution from environmental point of view, thermal treatment process proved itself to be the most appropriate solution. A unit for thermal treatment with capacity more than 100 tons of wet sludge per day had been built in one large pulp and paper plant some years ago, located in a mining area. When built, this unit was quite modern. However, because of an increasing number of more and more sweeping environmental laws affecting the process industry, the unit required a complete retrofit. The retrofit has been realised in three stages. The first stage provided mainly means to cut down the emissions below the limits given by environmental legislation. Second stage can be characterised as "waste-to-energy" one. The third stage of retrofit consisted in substituting the currently used fuel by mining gas. The unit for thermal treatment of sludge after retrofit can be considered as one of the most up-to-date incinerators with a waste-to-energy system at present. Economic profitability, positive environmental impact and other beneficial features of the retrofit are clearly shown. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The iron and steel industry is a major industrial emitter of carbon dioxide globally and in Germany. If European and German climate targets were set as equal proportional reduction targets (referred to here as “flat” targets) among sectors, the German steel industry would have to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions from about 60 million metric tons currently to 28–34 million metric tons by 2030. Technical options to further reduce CO2 that are based on existing production processes are limited. Hence, in the future, the CO2 emissions of the steel industry could be reduced by alternative and new production processes and variations in production levels. This paper describes four production pathways from 2015 to 2035 that reveal the impact of constant, increasing and decreasing production levels as well as different production processes. The diffusion of energy-efficient technologies, the increase of renewables in the German electricity mix and the age and lifetime of blast furnaces are considered as well. The findings suggest that the German steel sector will only manage to achieve its European CO2 emissions reduction target for 2030 if it strongly decreases its production levels. Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that the German steel sector will meet its German climate target regardless of the production pathway selected. The findings suggest that efforts to reduce CO2 emissions in the steel industry should focus on two areas. First, alternative steelmaking processes need to be developed. Besides low-CO2 process technologies, CO2-free processes should be considered as well. Direct reduced iron could be produced based on hydrogen and then fed into an electric arc furnace powered by electricity generated using CO2-free sources. Steel could also be produced using electrolysis based on CO2-free electricity. However, because these technologies might take decades to develop and introduce, there should be a second focus on incremental CO2 reductions in the short to medium term.},

abstract = {Heat is a major contributor to total energy demand of process industries. Therefore, integrating solar heat into processes is a suitable alternative for fossil fuels. However, there are several challenges in design and optimization of solar heat integration. In this paper, the proper distribution of solar heat among direct heating solar heat exchangers and different temperature levels of heat storage is analytically solved for. As a result, a new concept is developed which can help design and operate solar heat integrated systems with heat storage. In the case study, the effect of collector area and efficiency, minimum solar temperature difference, storage size, and heat loss rate on the solar fraction are evaluated. Results show that while there is virtually no difference in solar fraction when 1000 collectors are installed, it ranges from 17 to 47{\%} with 6000 collectors when thermal storage is possible and different collector efficiencies are included. In addition, the effect of storage type and size becomes significant only when enough number of collectors are installed to provide adequate excess heat during the sunny hours. The highest observed difference in solar fraction over the considered range of storage type and size was 1.5{\%}.},

The objective of this work is to propose a strategy to reduce the electricity bill for the industry under variable electricity pricing. In order to reduce the electricity bill, a fuzzy Inference System (FIS) based energy management strategy to produce electricity in low pricing period and utilize it in peak period is proposed by integrating small scale WtE and storage into industry system. Though this model is built for energy management, it indirectly works as a tool for waste management as well. The performance of the proposed model is tested with the data collected from a plastic container manufacturing industry. The cost analysis is shown to justify the higher establishment cost of WtE.},

Based on the life cycle of the food industry, five life stages were considered: agricultural production, industrial processing and packaging, transportation, wholesale and retail, and household. In this study, based on the causal relationships and feedback loops between these factors and the energy consumed for each life stage, a system dynamics (SD) model was designed to simulate the situation for the US food industry. Policy options of reducing waste percentage and improving industrial energy productivity are incorporated for building the energy use mitigation scenarios. By implementing the integrated mitigation scenarios, a 9.43{\%} reduction in total food system energy consumption can be attained in 2030.},

abstract = {The main objective of the present work is to evaluate the potentials of the installed existing units of gas turbines for combined production of cooling, heating, power, and process heat. For this purpose a CCHPP cycle is proposed and simulated thermodynamically. The thermodynamical model is enriched with technical data extracted from the data sheets and operational manual and data of the gas turbine. The thermodynamic, economic, and environmental criteria of the CCHPP cycle are evaluated and impact of different parameters on these criteria is evaluated. For instant the impact of remaining lifetime of the gas turbine, ambient temperature, altitude, relative humidity, interest rate, and currency exchange value is investigated. In the economical valuations the conventional payback period is modified and a new formula that is more conservative is proposed. The results prove that fuel saving of more than 30{\%} is achievable. Based on average consumption of natural gas in Iran, the amount of fuel saved can feed about 2450 and 5720 families in cold and hot climates respectively. The economical results show that for 1USD invested, about 0.5USD profit is achieved. Life analysis shows that for the existing gas turbines the minimum required life time for gas turbine to make the CCHPP investment profitable is about 15 years. Moreover the analyses show that the cycle characteristics are more sensitive to ambient temperature than relative humidity and altitude. The CO2, CO and NOxreduction of more than 52,000, 36 and 44 tons per year is estimated when using CCHPP.},

abstract = {The cement industry contributes about 5{\%} to global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and is thus an important sector in CO2-emission mitigation strategies. Carbon dioxide is emitted from the calcination process of limestone, from combustion of fuels in the kiln, and from the coal combustion during power generation. Strategies to reduce these CO2 emissions include energy efficiency improvement, new processes, shift to low carbon fuels or waste fuels in cement production, increased use of additives in cement production, alternative cements, and CO2 removal from flue gases in clinker kilns. Increased use of fly ash as an additive to cement and concrete has a number of advantages, the primary being reduction of costs of fly ash disposal, resource conservation, and cost reduction of the product. Since the production of cement requires a large amount of energy (about 2.9-3.2 GJt-1), the substitution of cement by fly ash saves not only energy but also reduces the associated greenhouse gas emissions. The paper evaluates the reduction of CO2 emissions that can be achieved by these mitigation strategies, as well as by partial substitution of cement by fly ash. The latter is important because the quality of the produced concrete depends on the physical-chemical properties of the fly ash and thus partial substitution as well as the type of fly ash (e.g., the content of CaO) has an effect not only on energy consumption and emissions, but also on the produced concrete quality.},

abstract = {In a future fossil-free circular economy, the petroleum-based plastics industry must be converted to non-fossil feedstock. A known alternative is bio-based plastics, but a relatively unexplored option is deriving the key plastic building blocks, hydrogen and carbon, from electricity through electrolytic processes combined with carbon capture and utilization technology. In this paper the future demand for electricity and carbon dioxide is calculated under the assumption that all plastic production is electricity-based in the EU by 2050. The two most important input chemicals are ethylene and propylene and the key finding of this paper is that the electricity demand to produce these are estimated to 20 MWh/ton ethylene and 38 MWh/ton propylene, and that they both could require about 3 tons of carbon dioxide/ton product. With constant production levels, this implies an annual demand of about 800 TWh of electricity and 90 Mton of carbon dioxide by 2050 in the EU. If scaled to the total production of plastics, including all input hydrocarbons in the EU, the annual demand is estimated to 1600 TWh of electricity and 180 Mton of carbon dioxide. This suggests that a complete shift to electricity-based plastics is possible from a resource and technology point of view, but production costs may be 2 to 3 times higher than today. However, the long time frame of this paper creates uncertainties regarding the results and how technical, economic and social development may influence them. The conclusion of this paper is that electricity-based plastics, integrated with bio-based production, can be an important option in 2050 since biomass resources are scarce, but electricity from renewable sources is abundant.},

abstract = {Energy conservation is critical for promoting urban low-carbon and sustainable development. Because a large amount of heat energy is wasted during energy conversion and transportation, the recovery of waste heat and its cascading use would substantially save resources and reduce CO2emissions. As a typical case of the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, direct extracting steam from incinerators for industrial use is considered more efficient than power generation, but hard to be popularized because of long distance heat transport. On the basis of the heat atlas, this study develops an integrated model to assess the feasibility of developing heat exchange network between incineration facilities and industries in city scale, and evaluates the impacts from land use on economic and environmental indices. The result reveals that maximum 45.2{\%} of the incineration waste heat can be utilized to cover 13.8{\%} of the heat consumption in industries, where annual net benefit and CO2emission reduction could achieve 63 billion JPY (≈0.6 billion USD) and 2200 kt CO2/year, respectively. However, current geographic separation between incineration facilities and industries brings a dilemma between economic and environmental benefits which will obstruct the popularization of waste heat exchange. Given this result, a cluster map to classify involved incineration facilities is provided which helps in establishing a renewal strategy considering positive land use adjustment. These results are also referable in urban planning integrated with distributed energy system as well as provide a case for promoting Urban Symbiosis.},

abstract = {Cement industry is one of the largest carbon emitting industrial sectors. It is responsible for about 5{\%} of anthropogenic CO2 in the world. Therefore, it is a relevant industrial sector for CO2 emission regulation strategies. Bearing in mind the importance of cement industry in Croatia, and because of the fact that Croatia will soon become an EU member state, the present paper analyses the potential to reduce CO2 emission in the Croatian cement industry. There are several measures that can reduce CO2 emissions from the cement manufacturing process: the use of waste heat as an alternative source of energy; CO2 capture and storage technologies; reduction of clinker to cement ratio; the use of alternative and biomass fuels; the use of alternative raw materials; an energy efficient combustion process. The most energy efficient technology for cement manufacturing today is the use of a rotary kiln together with a multi-stage preheater and a calciner. Since the use of cement calciners is a relatively new technology, further improvement of their operating conditions is still needed. This paper also highlights the results of research in the field of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations that are used for the investigation of process and combustion emissions. The above mentioned measures together with numerical investigations can reduce the effect of cement manufacturing in Croatia on the environment and can make it more competitive with cement manufacturers from the EU. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Direct heat transfer between plants is problematic because of the production schedule and frequent process start-ups and shutdowns that occur due to the need for regular cleaning. The dynamic operation of an industrial HRL at a large dairy factory is presented and briefly discussed. A model HRL based on a set of variable industrial stream data is used to examine the effect of heat storage capacity and HRL temperature range on the amount of heat recovery. Both HRL temperature range and a small heat storage volume can significantly improve the amount of heat recovery. The interface level in the storage tank is also modelled for different volumes and the resulting system is very dynamic and therefore good control needs to be incorporated into the HRL.

abstract = {To guide the adjustment of the electricity policies of the 13th Five-year Plan and the present market-oriented reforms, this paper performs a scenario analysis of the CO2 emissions from China's electric power industry. By using a logarithmic linear equation to explain the relationship between CO2 emissions and their influence factors, a hybrid model to forecast the “natural” development of the explanatory variables, and emission-relative data from 2001 to 2013 to estimate the equation parameters, five scenarios are designed, and the CO2 emissions of each scenario are forecasted for the period of 2016–2030. On the basis of the modeling results, the sensitivity and contribution of each variable are also measured. Empirical analysis draws the following conclusions. (1) The electric power industry of China cannot easily reach its CO2 emission peak before 2030. This will impose considerable pressure on the Chinese government to realize its emission mitigation target. (2) Compared with the non-fossil energy share in electricity generation, the CO2 emissions from China's electric power industry are more sensitive to the changes in total electricity consumption and thermal power generation efficiency. (3) The increase in total electricity consumption is the single most important contributor to CO2 emission growth from the electric power industry of China. (4) To mitigate future CO2 emissions from the electric power industry, the Chinese government should optimize the industrial export structure and enhance its awareness of the increase in household electricity consumption.},

The amount of useful product should equal the use of one substitute energy unit.

For the 22 most energy-intensive process industries, which represent about 80{\%} of the total primary energy use of the industrial sector, detailed end-use models were created and analysed with data for the years 2006 and 2012. The sectoral energy and exergy losses, as well as the exergy destruction, were further established to quantify the potential for recovering and valorising heat otherwise lost. By also considering transformation processes occurring in the utility sector, the impact of using electricity and district heat in the industry is shown. The exergy efficiencies for each process industry were found to be in the range of 12???56{\%} in 2012. However variations in the efficiencies within the sectors for individual process industries occur, underlining the need for detailed analyses. The exergy losses amounted to 3800 TJ for the same year. Meanwhile, the complete exergy losses, including the central production of heat and power, exceeded 8700 TJ. This analysis illustrates for the case study of Denmark how waste heat recovery potentials in the industrial sectors are found, by determining the sectors losses and exergy destruction. In addition the importance of applying a system analysis is shown, which corrects the site efficiencies for electricity and district heating use. The use of 22 industries, further highlights differences amongst industries belonging to the same sector.},

The framework involves an estimation of elasticity and technical change parameters for a constant elasticity of substitution function with capital, labour and energy, which is derived from the elasticities and marginal output. We apply the framework to investigate eleven Chinese energy-intensive industries. The optimal nested structure for eight of the industries is for capital and energy to be combined first at the composite level and then with labour to form total output. Between 1990 and 2012, six of the industries were energy biased, three were towards capital, one towards labour and one mixed. The results show that recent Chinese energy intensity reduction programs are not sufficient to induce energy efficient development. The policy recommendations target specifically the energy biased industries to achieve desired energy savings in the future.},

abstract = {Improved energy efficiency is one of the most effective strategies for achieving energy sustainability and independence locally, regionally and globally. Industry accounts for 40{\%} of global energy usage each year, which suggests its potentially significant impact on overall energy use. The rapid development of standards for more efficient equipment and components are pushing manufacturers towards further improvements on a component level. However, it has been shown that the largest efficiency potential is actually found in higher system levels in which components serve, such as production processes, ventilation or hydraulic systems. Even though the importance of increasing energy efficiency at a systemic level has been widely acknowledged in recent years, practical approaches are seldom discussed in the literature. This gap between aspiration and achievement calls for the development of new approaches to foster system efficiency in industrial systems. This paper presents a systems analysis and corresponding model to increase the energy efficiency of industrial processes that involve intensive usage of electric motor systems. The model originates from traditional value stream mapping. Three case studies representing three different industrial processes were conducted to develop and validate the model. In total, 31 energy efficiency measures were identified, 29 of which address actions beyond component levels. Alongside identifications of energy efficiency measures, the model promotes the creation of conditions for cross-functional worker participation. By applying this model, the knowledge and skills gained by industrial personnel working with improved energy efficiency, maintenance and production processes can be used immediately to generate improvement suggestions. The paper concludes that this model, based on a simplified energy-focused value stream mapping, could broaden the scope of energy efficiency actions, engage a larger group of workers within the organisation and increase systems efficiency. This can be further used as a practical tool for finding continuous improvement possibilities that will result in strengthened competitiveness and more cost-effective and sustainable manufacturing.},

Actions aiming at the reduction of the largest gaps are prioritized, taking into account the required resources and payback analyses. Four successful industrial case studies applying EGM in polymer processing are presented. In the first study, a blow molding process was diagnosed and the interventions obtained a specific energy consumption (SEC) reduction of 14{\%}. For the second study, the same process used in the first study was employed to intervene in a second machine, obtaining an SEC reduction of 65{\%}. For the third and fourth studies, an automotive part injection molding process was diagnosed and improved, obtaining SEC savings of 16{\%} for the part production and around 7{\%} for the whole production plant. EGM is not limited to polymer processing plants, and it could be adapted to other mass production processes.},

This paper uses statistical data from 285 cities, from 2004 to 2013, to analyze the effect of industrial agglomeration on energy efficiency. The spatial autocorrelation tests show that there is significant spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity in urban energy efficiency. Although dynamic spatial econometric results show that industrial agglomeration can promote an increase in energy efficiency from a country level, there are significant differences at a regional level. In the east, the effect of industrial agglomeration on energy efficiency has a threshold effect, but in central and western areas, industrial agglomeration can promote the increase of energy efficiency, with the positive effect in western areas greater than that in central areas. Finally, based on the research, this paper puts forward concrete suggestions to enhance energy efficiency.},

By using the panel data of 21 industrial segments between 2000 and 2015, this paper investigates the driving effect of technological innovation on energy-utilization efficiency in strategic emerging industries and analyzes the critical factors influencing the driving effect of technological innovation by the stochastic frontier analysis method. The empirical result shows that technological innovation between 2000 and 2015 has had a significant positive driving effect on the energy utilization efficiency of strategic emerging industries and exhibits a development trend of year-by-year steady-state growth on the whole. The greater the value of the development expenditure of new green products and the investment in environmental pollution treatment, the greater the technological efficiency; the greater the value of the transformation expenditure of energy-saving technology, the greater the technological inefficiency. Finally, the paper proposes the countermeasures and suggestions for the driving effect of technological innovation on energy utilization efficiency in strategic emerging industries. An empirical study is made to analyze the driving effect of technological innovation on energy utilization efficiency, the positive and negative factors of technological innovation are forgotten. Strategic emerging industries can select optimal innovation behavior to improve quality and efficiency of energy utilization based on the results.},

However, without full internalization of external costs, greenhouse gas mitigation as such may not be highly prioritized among business leaders. Rather, it is the magnitude of production costs and ultimately the size of market revenue that articulates success or failure for business leaders. Nevertheless, reduced energy use or improved energy efficiency can have a vast impact on profitability even for companies with low energy costs, as the reduced energy costs directly lead to increased profits. In this paper, a review of ten years of empirical research in the field of industrial energy management in Swedish industry is presented. Based on the review, the paper proposes success factors for efficient energy management, factors which could help guide individual energy managers as well as policy makers in order to close the energy efficiency and management gaps. The paper also presents an overview of important industrial energy management tools, which would facilitate in-house energy management in industry.},

To understand the energy efficiency evolution of China's paper industry, this paper establishes an input-output data of the paper industry for 29 provinces in China and applies DEA method and econometric models to estimate and comprehensively discuss the energy efficiency issues based on the framework of total factor efficiency. Our results indicate that China's paper industry has a large energy saving potential even though its energy efficiency has improved during the period 1990–2013. The saving potential is about 65{\%} under the meta-frontier and 44{\%} under the group-frontier. Moreover, there are significant differences between different regions in production technology and energy efficiency. The performance of eastern China is better than other regions. But the technology gaps between the different regions are shrinking and converging over time. Finally, some policy recommendations are proposed to improve the energy efficiency of the industry.},

These six industries are capital and energy intensive and have a great impact on the energy consumption of China, so they are directly related to the achievement of the energy conservation goal in the 13th Five Year Plan. This paper investigates the influential factors of energy consumption in the industries by employing the cointegration method, and estimates the possible energy conservation potential considering energy rebound effect. The results show that GDP and the scale of industries are the deterministic factors increasing energy consumption, while R{\&}D intensity decreases it. Energy price has little impact on energy consumption. The average energy rebound effect is calculated using the latent variable approach and the result is 90.75{\%}. Considering energy rebound effect, the energy conservation potential of China's energy intensive industries is 14.18–26.54 million tons of standard coal equivalent in 2020 and 44.64–80.72 million tons of standard coal equivalent in 2030.},

abstract = {When industrial firms invest in energy efficiency, the effect may go beyond energy cost savings and produce additional non-energy benefits as well. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding experiences in non-energy benefits and the extent to which these are acknowledged by industry. This study attempts to explore firms' perspectives on non-energy benefits of industrial energy-efficiency investments and if and how non-energy benefits are considered in the investment process. Moreover, this study also explores investment motives and critical aspects of adopting energy-efficiency investments. Based on a questionnaire and interviews with representatives of Swedish industrial firms, the results indicate that energy efficiency seems to be an important issue for the firms, but profitability and payoff appear to be the most important factors for adopting an investment, implying that it is often difficult to meet the payoff requirements with energy cost savings alone. In the meantime, various non-energy benefits are observed, but there seems to be a lack of knowledge of how these should be quantified and monetised. To facilitate such an assessment of non-energy benefits and to include them in the investment analysis, a measurement framework is provided. It is concluded that including non-energy benefits in the investment analysis can contribute to a framing of energy-efficiency investments that can meet the firms' requirements for profitability assessment, which can further enhance opportunities for energy-efficiency investments in industry. Thus, the study contributes with new insights into the energy-efficiency investment process and the extent to which non-energy benefits are considered, along with the methods for measuring them.},

First, the classification of the industrial energy efficiency index has been summarized to track the previous application studies. The single measurement indicator and the composite index benchmarking are highly recognized as the modeling tools for power industries and policy-making in worldwide countries. They are the pivotal figures to convey the fundamental information in energy systems for improving the performance in fields such as economy, environment and technology. Second, the six factors that influence the energy efficiency in industry are discussed. Third, four major evaluation methodologies of energy efficiency are explained in detail, including stochastic frontier analysis, data envelopment analysis, exergy analysis and benchmarking comparison. The basic models and the developments of these methodologies are introduced. The recent utilization of these methodologies in the energy efficiency evaluations are illustrated. Some drawbacks of these methodologies are also discussed. Other related methods or influential indicators for measuring energy efficiency performance have also been presented.

abstract = {Generally waste heat, waste water and waste streams are available as industrial energy resources in industrial plants and their roof areas for solar energy use. In Austria, until now, only waste heat has been used in small parts for heat supply of towns. The application of waste heat has so far been largely taken for internal heat recovery only. A holistic approach considering all available energy resources by the industry in synergetic connection with the surrounding urban areas is yet to feature. Only a few projects in terms of waste heat usage for district heating have been implemented. At international level, the utilization of industrial energy has also hardly been considered in a synergistic combination with the municipal authorities. Numerous legal requirements (Directive for Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control, law for energy efficiency) determine conditions for industrial companies in terms of their environmental performance and energy savings etc. To a large extent, the production processes are already optimized due to the application of quality management systems and other tools. With the help of other energy efficiency methods it is hardly possible to achieve the required energy efficiency savings without influencing the production process. Therefore, the energetic linking of industrial companies and urban areas through the usage of industrial energy, to cover the energy demand of the towns offers an energy efficiency measure for industries without biasing their economic behaviour. Additionally, this approach represents an opportunity for energy enhancing independency of specific regions. The potentials for synergies were examined based on four project regions in Austria with a population between 7000 and 12,000 inhabitants and a more or less strong penetration of industrial companies. It was found that in total, up to 35{\%} of the total energy demand of the surveyed towns could be covered. This means also a saving of the primary energy demand for the towns in the same extent. For electricity, coverage of up to 46{\%}, and for heat, coverage of up to 32{\%}, are possible. That means that nearly no oversupply of the towns occurs and all accumulating industrial energy can be taken by the towns. The recovery and exploitation of the so far unemployed industrial energy leads to a significant increase of efficiency for the industrial companies.},

The present research examines the positive contribution of this composite efficiency to the growth of final outputs in this sector, using the two-stage method of Malmquist efficiency analysis (MEA) and the linear regression of panel data from about 154 Korean industries from 2010 to 2012. The results found that composite efficiency and changes in the production factors have positive impacts on industrial productivity. In particular, relative efficiency has a positive influence on productivity, but technical efficiency does not have a significant impact. Our findings suggest that industries may voluntarily make efforts to improve their use of energy resources, but they also need to invest in energy technologies and develop efficient production structures, with the help of public policies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Elsevier Ltd. Improvement of coal consumption efficiency is very important both for China in solving its problems of energy security and environmental pollution and for the world in addressing the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. Using a total-factor framework, this paper employs a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach to evaluate the coal consumption efficiency of six energy intensive sub-industries in China in 2015. Coal consumption efficiency is factorized into economic efficiency and environmental efficiency, with sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and industrial smoke, dust and soot emissions treated as undesirable outputs of energy consumptions. The results show the following. (1) Of the six energy intensive sub-industries studied, two exhibit both DEA-effective coal economic efficiency and coal environmental efficiency. Coal economic efficiency is found to be greater than coal environmental efficiency, indicating that the benefits of economic efficiency have masked the negative effects of the environmental impact. China should therefore pay more attention to the clean utilization of coal. (2) Low environmental efficiency mainly resulted from the joint effects of pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency; therefore, enterprises in these industries must engage in management efforts to improve their ability to manage large enterprises. (3) The energy intensive industries characterized by coal environmental efficiency that failed to achieve pure technological effectiveness all exhibited input redundancy or output inadequacy of varying degrees while showing a potential for energy conservation and emissions reductions.},

Moreover, according to 2010/75/EU Directive, IPPC permits should be based on Best Available Techniques (BAT) aimed to reach an adequate level of environmental protection and should establish all the necessary measures including operating conditions, emission limit values for relevant polluting substances as well as monitoring requirements. Thus, in the present paper an assessment of Best Available Techniques (BAT) related to energy efficiency in the main Italian industrial installations is carried out on the base of the analysis on the IPPC permits released by the Italian Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea, and made available on its web site. As a result a significant improvement in energy efficiency was assessed. In fact, many process units were upgraded, by major revamping or even by replacing the process completely with one showing better performances. Finally, since energy efficiency is at its best at the beginning of the life cycle of the plant, operators, whenever necessary, periodically monitor and measure the actual energy performance of their own installations for process control and maintenance purposes.},

abstract = {Following the impressive economic achievements in the past decades, China is faced with energy and environmental challenges. To carry out more effective and targeted energy policies, the heterogeneities of different industrial sectors are of great importance. The energy consumption of China's light industry in 2012 was 316 million tons of coal equivalents, which is about the energy consumption of South Korea. The paper explored the substitution relationships between various input factors and fuel sources, and showed that electricity price reform is crucial for energy conservation in China's light industry. Then, the dynamics of energy intensity change is examined by decomposing energy intensity into budget effect, substitution effect, output effect and technology advance effect. The result revealed that the substitution effect between input factors is a key driving force. However, technology progress seems to contribute very little. For future energy policy alternatives, promoting the implementation of new conservation technology and electricity price reform may be effective measures.},

abstract = {Thailand has recently implemented the Alternative Energy Development Plan (2015–2036) aiming to reduce the dependency on conventional fuels, notably diesel from oil palm. To ensure sustainability of substituting diesel, this study aims to assess the environmental effects of three promising biofuels namely, conventional biodiesel or Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), Bio-hydrogenated diesel (BHD) and the newest alternative fuel, Partially Hydrogenated Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (H-FAME) compared to diesel in transport sector. The system boundary is “Well-to-Wheels. This study does not show a significant difference in the energy performances and environmental effects of the studied biofuels. The partial substitution of diesel by FAME, H-FAME and BHD can decrease fossil use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions significantly. In terms of global warming potential GWP, more than 100 million tonnes CO2eq would be reduced in the next 20 years according to the projection of 25{\%} replaced conventional diesel consumption. To improve the performance in terms of resource use and GHG mitigation, the study results suggest encouraging the use of H-FAME and BHD as a good choice. Both these alternative fuels can be blended with conventional diesel more than 2 times compared with FAME. In the initial stage, substitution could start with implementing H-FAME and slightly reduce the use of FAME after which BHD could be implemented along with FAMEand H-FAME.},

abstract = {As buildings are constructed to be more energy-efficient and environmental friendly, the building construction industry, which is a basic and leading industry of the national economy development, has become one of the key sectors for energy conservation and emission reduction in China. This paper aims at quantifying both inter-factor and inter-energy substitution for China's building construction industry and investigate the main driving forces behind energy efficiency changes as well as the CO2 abatement effect of a uniform carbon tax in this sector. The model is established employing provincial pooled data over 2003–2012 in China by regions; hence, results between different regions are compared. The main findings indicate that: (i) energy and non-energy are substitutes whereas individual energy inputs are complementary in China's building construction industry. The substitution effect varies across regions due to different factor endowments and marketization levels. (ii) Energy price increase and construction scale expansion leads to energy efficiency improvement while substitution and technology present negative influences on energy efficiency. (iii) Approximately 3{\%} of the CO2 emissions in China's building construction industry can be reduced by carbon taxation based on the integrated own- and cross- price elasticities of each energy.},

abstract = {Climate change which is induced from energy consumption and CO2 emissions has got people's attention; hence, many strategies and ways are being adopted to mitigate CO2 emissions. Energy substitution is crucial to the promotion of energy conservation and CO2 emissions reduction. The purpose of this paper is to estimate both inter-factor and inter-fuel substitution in China's iron {\&} steel industry during the period 1985–2011. Empirical results show several conclusions for China's iron {\&} steel industry: (1) own-price elasticity of energy is negative, so increase in energy price will reduce energy input; (2) energy and capital, and energy and labor are substitutes, and the substitution in energy/capital is relatively stronger; (3) though coal, oil and electricity are also substitutes, the substitution effect is not so obvious because of pricing distortions in China. The driving forces of energy efficiency change are further discussed and the results show that technology progress is the key factor determining energy intensity. Therefore, market-oriented reforms in terms of energy prices, improvement in energy substitution (including inter-factor and inter-fuel substation) and promotion of energy saving technologies are important means for ensuring future energy conservation and CO2 emissions reduction practices in China's iron {\&} steel sector.},

abstract = {A life cycle assessment (LCA) model has been developed to evaluate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the use of alternative fuels in the production of clinker, an intermediate product in the manufacture of cement, and to confirm the categorization of these alternatives as low carbon fuels (LCFs) compared to the conventional use of fossil fuels. This model has included all GHG emission sources associated with clinker production, such as the kiln process, production and transportation of raw materials and fuels, and electricity production. Four potential LCFs are investigated including construction and demolition (C{\&}D) wood waste, asphalt shingles, railway ties, and plastics. At the case study plant (Lafarge Cement in Bath, Ontario), the model estimates that the production of 1 metric tonne (t) of clinker produces a total of 971.4 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents (including all GHGs from fuels and raw materials), of which 388.6 kg CO2-e are associated with combustion of fossil fuels at a mixture of 99 wt{\%} petroleum coke and 1 wt{\%} coal. Emissions are decreased to 582.6 kg CO2-e/t clinker (a 40{\%} reduction) when 100{\%} fossil fuels are replaced with C{\&}D wood waste, in which all carbon is from biogenic sources. If the volume of C{\&}D waste required to fuel 100{\%} of cement plant operation were to be diverted from a typical landfill (with no flaring or energy recovery), emissions equivalent to 488.6 kg of CO2-e/t clinker would be avoided. Using 100{\%} C{\&}D waste, the reduced emissions in energy production coupled with avoided emissions at the landfill would effectively reduce total emissions at the plant by more than 90{\%} compared to the baseline emissions associated with fossil fuel use. All four of the alternative fuels examined with the model provided significant GHG emission reductions at higher substitution rates, confirming their characterization as LCFs, and suggesting that the use of LCFs in cement manufacture can be effective in reducing emissions associated with global warming. Since the LCA model is able to predict the global warming potential (GWP) for any potential LCFs at any substitution ratios, it may be used as a pre-screening tool for the selection of future LCFs for the cement and other carbon-intensive industries, facilitating increased LCF usage and hence contributing to GHG reductions across the cement sector.},

Using a proposed meta-frontier data envelopment analysis (DEA), this paper analyzes the total-factor energy efficiency and energy savings potential in China's provincial industrial sectors for the years 2000–2014 from three perspectives, namely, the technology gap, management, and scale. The results indicate that (1) driven by technological progress, energy efficiency during the sample period was greatly improved, though the expansion of technology gaps between regions and the decline in scale efficiency represented two significant handicaps; (2) the current energy efficiency in China's industrial sectors remains extremely low, indicating that there is considerable potential for energy efficiency improvement and energy savings; and (3) the sources of energy inefficiency and energy savings potential in China's industrial sectors exhibit spatially distinct characteristics. Accordingly, it is determined that most of China's eastern provinces should focus on improving scale and management efficiency, whereas most of its central and western provinces should concentrate on three factors: narrowing the regional technology gap, improving management efficiency, and optimizing the industrial scale.},

abstract = {Energy consumption in Pakistan increased significantly over the last two decades primarily due to industrialization. In order to meet the growing energy needs, the government adopted short-term policies by setting up thermal power projects, which are more expensive both in terms of fiscal cost and environmental damages as compared to hydro power projects. The former has exposed Pakistan to international oil price shocks and environmental degradations. This study, therefore, attempts to analyze technical change using trans-log production function by employing non-energy factors (i.e. capital and labor) and energy factors (i.e. petroleum and natural gas) to estimate elasticity of substitution. The purpose of the study is to provide policy suggestions to the government on how to achieve high economic growth vis-{\`{a}}-vis improved energy security and environmental sustainability. The results reveal that capital-energy and labor-energy are substitutes, thereby suggesting the need for an increased focus on technological advancement and skilled employment generation to conserve energy and reduce CO2emission. A gradual elimination of energy subsidies, which will make energy price reflects its true cost, is required to further discourage increased energy consumption and promote capital intensive production methods. A scenario analysis based on the elasticity of substitution between capital-energy and petroleum-gas shows the potential of energy conservation and emission mitigation. The results further suggest the importance of a diversified energy supply mix characterized by abundant hydro and other renewable energy resources alongside natural gas.},

abstract = {The share of renewable energy in the Danish energy sector is increasing and the goal is that biogas production should reach a production level of 17 petajoules (PJ) in 2020 according to the Danish Energy Agency. However, this goal is currently not reachable due to lack of investments in biogas plants. In this paper, a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for finding the optimal production and investment plan for a biogas supply chain is presented to ensure better economy for the full chain hopefully stimulating future investments in biogas. The model makes use of step-wise linear functions to represent capital and operational expenditures at the biogas plant; considers the chain from the farmer to the end market; and includes changes of mass and energy content along the chain by modeling the losses and gains for all processes in the chain. Biomass inputs are scheduled on a weekly basis whereas energy outputs are scheduled on an hourly basis to better capture the changes of energy prices and potentially take advantage of these changes. The model is tested on a case study with co-digestion of straw, sugar beet and manure, considering natural gas, heat, and electricity as end products. The model finds a production and investment plan for a predefined location of the plant within half an hour of central processing unit (CPU) time. The resulting project turns out to be profitable and gives a production plan for each process, which underlines the possibilities of optimizing the processes in a biogas project.},

abstract = {Biogas production is characterised by economies of scale in capital and operational costs of the plant and diseconomies of scale from transport of input materials. We analyse biogas in a Danish setting where most biogas is based on manure, we use a case study with actual distances, and find that the benefits of scale in capital and operational costs dominate the diseconomies of increasing transport distances to collect manure. To boost the yield it is common to use co-substrates in the biogas production. We investigate how costs and income changes, when sugar beet is added in this case study, and demonstrate that transport cost can be critical in relation to co-substrates. Further we compare the new Danish support for upgraded biogas with the traditional support for biogas being used in Combined Heat and Power production in relation to scale economies. We argue that economies of scale is facilitated by the new regulation providing similar support to upgraded biogas fed into the natural gas grid, however in order to keep transport costs low, we suggest that the biogas plants should be allowed to use and combine as many co-substrates as possible, respecting the sustainability criteria regarding energy crops in Danish legislation.},

Developed over the second half of the twentieth century, they are now seeing increased relevance in the face of stringent climate policy, energy security and economic development concerns, and increasing challenges due to the changing nature of the twenty-first century energy system. In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the EU and in Denmark, the aim is to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and to use energy more efficiently. District heating and combined heat and power have significant potential with regard to achieving this aim. New technologies may make individual solutions such as electric heating, heat pumps and micro-CHP more attractive than previously. Therefore, the competitive conditions between district heating and other types of heating may change in the future. The question is therefore whether district heating can contribute to ensuring the sustainability of future energy systems? Denmark is used as a case as the country has a high share of district heating and produces 20{\%} of the electricity with wind power. The analyses are carried out using the electricity market model Balmorel, which facilitates cost optimization of operation and investments in energy production plants as well as electricity transmission. To be able to perform the analysis an extension of the model is developed, where it is also possible to optimize between investments in individual heating plants or in expansion of the district heating networks, depending on investment costs, energy density of the potential areas and their distance to existing district heating networks. Results show that district heating may contribute to the sustainability and security of supply of future energy systems and that under the given assumptions it is cost effective to increase the share of district heating up to 55-57{\%} of the heat demand although substantial heat saving measures are installed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper describes a novel modelling approach developed to assess the geographic and temporal set-up of an infrastructure for a hydrogen-based transport system in Germany till 2030 and to analyse the effects on the national energy system. The results show that the fossil hydrogen production dominates while the infrastructure is being developed and that the mix between gas and coal is highly sensitive to the price ratios. Even in this case, a remarkable CO2 reduction is achievable. In the first decade, decentralised plants play an important role, but also industrial by-product hydrogen. The introduction of hydrogen in areas with high population density minimises infrastructure costs. Liquefied hydrogen is economic with large plants and dispersed hydrogen demand. In the long run, co-production of electricity and hydrogen in IGCC plants (with CCS) is a promising option, particularly under restrictive CO2 regimes. ?? 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

The process towards liberalisation of the electricity sector started with a situation of a large capacity margin, which is gradually vanishing. Since potential investors in new production capacity are unaccustomed with investments under the new regime, it is unknown if and when investments will take place. The purpose of this paper is to analyze if and when investors choose to invest in new production capacity depending on their existing portfolio of power producing units. Electricity price scenarios generated with a partial equilibrium model of the Nordic power system are combined with a model of investment decisions. In this, various scenarios for the development in key parameters such as CO2 emission permit price and development in installed wind power capacity are used to investigate the consequences for investments in a natural gas fired power plant. The main result of the analysis is that new investments are highly sensitive to investors existing power production portfolio, as new production units compete with the existing power plants. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Affected energy production is often decisive for the outcome of consequential life-cycle assessments when comparing the potential environmental impact of products or services. Affected energy production is however difficult to determine. In this article the future long-term affected energy production is identified by use of energy system analysis. The focus is on different uses of waste for energy production. The Waste-to-Energy technologies analysed include co-combustion of coal and waste, anaerobic digestion and thermal gasification. The analysis is based on optimization of both investments and production of electricity, district heating and bio-fuel in a future possible energy system in 2025 in the countries of the Northern European electricity market (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Germany). Scenarios with different CO2 quota costs are analysed. It is demonstrated that the waste incineration continues to treat the largest amount of waste. Investments in new waste incineration capacity may, however, be superseded by investments in new Waste-to-Energy technologies, particularly those utilising sorted fractions such as organic waste and refuse derived fuel. The changed use of waste proves to always affect a combination of technologies. What is affected varies among the different Waste-to-Energy technologies and is furthermore dependent on the CO2 quota costs and on the geographical scope. The necessity for investments in flexibility measures varies with the different technologies such as storage of heat and waste as well as expansion of district heating networks. Finally, inflexible technologies such as nuclear power plants are shown to be affected. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

With hourly metering of individual customers, data for individual consumption profiles is available. Using this data and analysing the case of Denmark, we show that consumption profiles for categories of customers are equally systematic but very different for distinct categories, that is, distinct categories of customers contribute differently to the aggregated electricity load profile. Therefore, to model and forecast long-term changes in the aggregated electricity load profile, we identify profiles for different categories of customers and link these to projections of the aggregated annual consumption by categories of customers. Long-term projection of the aggregated load is important for future energy system planning, and the hourly load profile is an important input to energy system models that serves this purpose. In particular, these models often assume an unchanged hourly load profile (although the level may change). In contrast, our model suggests that the hourly load profile also changes as the shares of consumption by categories of customers change and new consumption technologies such as electrical vehicles and (for Denmark in particular) individual heat pumps are introduced. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In Denmark, at present the method used for grid planning is based on statistical analysis of the hour of maximum load and for each local area the maximum load is projected to change proportional to changes in the aggregated national electricity consumption. That is, specific local conditions are not considered. Yet, from measurements of local consumption we know that:. ???consumption profiles differ between local areas,???consumption by categories of customers contribute differently to the aggregated consumption profile,???the weight of categories of customers differ between local areas.In this paper we present a model calculating local consumption as composed of consumption by categories of customers with specific consumption profiles and different weights in local areas.

The model is estimated on data for the years 2009-2011 (in total 26,280 hourly observations). To evaluate how the model describes present consumption in local areas, observed and simulated hourly load duration curves for 2011 are compared.

abstract = {The need for deep decarbonisation in the energy intensive basic materials industry is increasingly recognised. In light of the vast future potential for renewable electricity the implications of electrifying the production of basic materials in the European Union is explored in a what-if thought-experiment. Production of steel, cement, glass, lime, petrochemicals, chlorine and ammonia required 125??TW-hours of electricity and 851??TW-hours of fossil fuels for energetic purposes and 671??TW-hours of fossil fuels as feedstock in 2010. The resulting carbon dioxide emissions were equivalent to 9{\%} of total greenhouse gas emissions in EU28. A complete shift of the energy demand as well as the resource base of feedstocks to electricity would result in an electricity demand of 1713??TW-hours about 1200??TW-hours of which would be for producing hydrogen and hydrocarbons for feedstock and energy purposes. With increased material efficiency and some share of bio-based materials and biofuels the electricity demand can be much lower. Our analysis suggest that electrification of basic materials production is technically possible but could have major implications on how the industry and the electric systems interact. It also entails substantial changes in relative prices for electricity and hydrocarbon fuels.},
